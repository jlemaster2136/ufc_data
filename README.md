# UFC Stats Cleaner and Predictor

This project is designed to clean and visualize UFC data and predict future fights. 

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: The cleaning_data.py file includes cleaning and manipulation of the data, which generated rate, volume and accuracy based stats.
- **Machine Learning**: I will upload my Random Forest Classifier model once I have it fully optimized... TBD!

I used the Greco1899's [code](https://github.com/Greco1899/scrape_ufc_stats) for data scraping, so thank you to them!
